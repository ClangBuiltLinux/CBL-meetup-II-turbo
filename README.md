# Clang Built Linux Meetup II turbo (2021)

A follow up to our
[2020](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/CBL-meetup-2020-slides)
meetup; this time virtually.

A one day meeting to discuss any and all things related to building the Linux
kernel with Clang (and LLVM), before heading into
[Linux Plumbers Conf 2021](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/)
the next week.

See also slides from
[our event last year](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/CBL-meetup-2020-slides)
for ideas of subject matter and target audience (ie. a mix of kernel
developers, compiler devs, folks who understand one or the other, perhaps
both).

## When

Friday September 17 2021; times to be determined.

## Call For Papers (CFP)

Please file an issue at
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/CBL-meetup-II-turbo/issues with a proposal.
The CFP deadline is Friday September 10; one week before the conference. We
will add a schedule here with accepted talks.
